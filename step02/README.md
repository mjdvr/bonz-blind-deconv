# step02
Folder in which the further steps are taken towards the end goal.
In this step:
 - implement a blind Richardson-Lucy algorithm
    (using a starting guess for the PSF, probably a Gaussian)
 - improve the accuracy of the algorithm
 - increase the complexity the algorithm can handle reasonably
